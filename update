    What to do :
        figure out if i delete a data with a reference do i need to delete that referenced data also with it ?      DONE

        add logic to to every controller based on the user's role and features and permission after being done with every controller 
        require Auth 
        each user has his own quizzes and a settings page that can delete and modify(if possible) and view the previous quizzes 
        add logic to all the requests : if they need role verification and user authentication 

        the idea is to have all users have access to the dashboard but with limited features based on their role
